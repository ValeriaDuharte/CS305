Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that provides personalized financial planning services, including savings strategies, retirement planning, investment guidance, and insurance recommendations. Artemis Financial partnered with Global Rain to modernize their web-based software application. Their primary goals were to: Enhance the functionality and user experience of their RESTful API. Secure the application against common external threats. Comply with current software security standards and best practices.
I performed a vulnerability assessment of Artemis Financial’s RESTful API, reviewing endpoints, request and response patterns, and associated backend code for common security flaws. Coding securely is essential to prevent exploits that can compromise user data, damage brand reputation, and incur legal and financial consequences. Strong software security boosts user trust, ensures data integrity, and aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
One of the most enjoyable and successful parts of this assessment was running dependency testing. It helped identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and ensured that all components were up to date and secure. Writing secure code reduces the risk of weaknesses that attackers can exploit. When software is built with security in mind, it adds credibility and trust to the organization. For Artemis Financial, this is especially important, as a secure platform builds client confidence, ultimately attracting more customers.
The most challenging part of the assessment was identifying false positives—results that appeared to be vulnerabilities but weren't actually threats. Differentiating between real issues and false alarms took careful analysis. The most helpful resource was using Eclipse’s web browser view, which allowed me to visually monitor the behavior of the application during development. Dependency check tools played a vital role in identifying insecure components.
One project I would highlight to future employers is this Vulnerability Assessment Report. It demonstrates my ability to: Identify and assess security risks, use tools to detect vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and analyze and interpret scan results, including handling false positives effectively.
