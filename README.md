Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that provides personalized financial planning services, including savings strategies, retirement planning, investment guidance, and insurance recommendations. Artemis Financial partnered with Global Rain to modernize their web-based software application. Their primary goals were to: Enhance the functionality and user experience of their RESTful API. Secure the application against common external threats. Comply with current software security standards and best practices.
I performed a vulnerability assessment of Artemis Financial’s RESTful API, reviewing endpoints, request and response patterns, and associated backend code for common security flaws. Coding securely is essential to prevent exploits that can compromise user data, damage brand reputation, and incur legal and financial consequences. Strong software security boosts user trust, ensures data integrity, and aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
The most challenging was analyzing authentication flows and session management was the most complex, especially tracing token expiration, refresh logic, and ensuring JWT tokens weren’t exposed or misused. The most helpful was using static analysis tools like SonarQube helped quickly identify insecure code patterns and areas prone to bugs.
